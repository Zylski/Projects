***Product Report application***

This product report application bundle contains everything you need to generate product reports using the company Product Master and Sales csv files. The report provides insights on product name, gross revenue, and total units sold.

To launch this program, install the latest version of Python, then navigate with your command line to the folder containing these files, then lauch the command "ProductReport.py ProductMaster.csv Sales.csv ProductReport.csv" If your files are named something different, rename them accordingly. The last .csv in the above mentioned command is the output file name. After launching the command, the program should generate a report of the specified name in the folder. If an error message occurs, check files and input for errors.

The application is very particular about how the csv files should be read.

Product master should be in the format: 1,Minor Widget,0.25,250
Sales should be: 6,55,4,40 

Included are sample Sales and ProductMaster files. Replace them with your own.

Thank you for using this application
